    "# Tutorial 03 - Working with Multiple Ephys Files\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we have used the pyCAP.Ephys class to load in a and work with a single data set at a time. Often when we collect electrophysiology data, we collect multiple data sets with a similar experimental setup. It is common to want to analyze these data sets in the same way. For this reason pyCAP was designed around being able to work with multiple data sets at on time. Due to the fact that pyCAP relies on lazy computation, 'loading' and working with multiple data sets usually has minimal computional cost compared to working with a single data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous tutorial we used the following code to read in a single dataset:\n",
    "    directory = 'C:/Users/james/OneDrive/Documents/Data/pyCAP/TDT/pnpig200113-200113-142737'\n",
    "    data = pyCAP.Ephys(directory)\n",
    "    \n",
    "We can instead load in a series of data sets by passing a list of file paths to pyCAP.Ephys. Here we import pyCAP and then create a list of file paths for a series of TDT data tanks collected as part of the same experiment. To create the list of data sets, we will use the python glob module (https://docs.python.org/3/library/glob.html) which provides a nice way to work with directories of files in python. However, there are many ways that this could be done."
