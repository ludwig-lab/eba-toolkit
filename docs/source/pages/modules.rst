eba-toolkit Modules
===================
.. TODO: write docstrings for each class and method to include in the documentation
.. TODO: create more automodules if necessary

This page documents the eba-toolkit classes and their methods.

*Note that eba-toolkit objects are never modified in place. Each 'property' method is a getter method that allows properties
to be accessed as normal attributes but not modified. All other methods will return new eba-toolkit objects with different
properties or non-eba-toolkit objects.*
